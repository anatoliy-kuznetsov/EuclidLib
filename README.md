# EuclidLib: A library of nonconvex optimization problems involving the Euclidean norm

This repository hosts a collection of nonconvex optimization problem instances involving the Euclidean norm from various applications across mathematics, science, and engineering.
These problems are known to be particularly challenging for deterministic global optimization solvers due to their inherent symmetries as well as the presence of reverse convex constraints involving the Euclidean norm.
The purpose of EuclidLib is to provide a benchmark to assist in solver development.
Instances are provided in GAMS, JuMP, and Pyomo formats, with and without starting points.
